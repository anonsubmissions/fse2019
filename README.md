# Empirical Results Reported in RQ4 
## OfficialDocumentationUsage.xlsx
The spreadsheet shows the code examples and API types found in two official documentation most discussed APIs in our dataset. This information is used in RQ4, such as to understand how many of the mined scenarios are actually covered in the official documentation.

## The User Study
The user study actual data are available in the files:
Solutions to Coding Tasks: G1-JGXS.csv, G2-GXSJ.csv, G3-SJGX.csv, G4-XSJG.csv, 
Survey: SurveyResponses.xlsx

The goal of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of our tool to assist in coding tasks. The objects were the APIs and their
usage summaries in our tool Uminer, Stack Overflow, Official documentation, and via Search Engines. The subjects were the participants who each completed four coding tasks.

## Four Coding Tasks 
Each task was required to be completed using a pre-selected API. Thus for the four tasks, each participant needed to use four different APIs: Task1 using Jackson, Task 2 using Gson, Task 3 using Xstream, and Task 4 Spring framework. Jackson and Gson are two of the most popular Java APIs for JSON parsing. Spring is one of the most popular web framework in Java and XStream is well-regarded for its efficient adherence to the JAXB principles, i.e., XML to JSON conversion and vice versa.

## Online Google Doc Forms to Conduct the Study
The anonymized Google doc forms are available here:
1. https://goo.gl/forms/13vuqcQGAgpQV8gr2
2. https://goo.gl/forms/QK3qS5laeAz2c1Ny1
3. https://goo.gl/forms/CAh2HrIgeOPorN8D2
4. https://goo.gl/forms/TNFSVXqBqX7vQusY2

For each group, a seven page instruction guide is produced and shared with each participant to ensure they understood the task requirements. Once a participant completed the coding tasks, he was invited to share his/her experience of using our tool and the API resources they used in their coding task in a separate Google doc form. Each participant was asked to share his/her unbiased opinion.

## Study Design
We answer the following two questions.
RQ1. How useful is the [TOOL] to support development tasks?
RQ2. How useful is the [TOOL] over API official and informal documentation?
The goal of [TOOL] is to assist developers in finding the right solutions to their coding tasks with relative ease than other resources.
Therefore, to assess the effectiveness of [TOOL] in real-world coding tasks (RQ1), we conducted a user study involving programmers.
A total of 31 programmers participated. The purpose of developing [TOOL] is to add benefits over existing API documentation.
Therefore, to examine the usefulness of [TOOL] over both API formal and informal documents (RQ2), we conducted a survey with the
31 the participants who completed the coding tasks. We asked them questions with regards to the observed value [TOOL] might have
added over the API documents in their coding tasks.
The coding tasks (RQ1) were completed by a total of 31 participants. The survey for RQ2 was answered by 29 out of the 31
participants who completed coding tasks in RQ1. The surveys were conducted separately. The surveys were conducted after the
participants completed their coding tasks. Among the 31 participants, 18 were professional developers. The rest of the participants were
recruited from four universities.

Our design was a between-subject design [28], with four different groups of participants, each participant
completing four tasks in four different settings. Our between-subject design allowed us to avoid repetition by using a different group
of subjects for each treatment. To avoid potential bias in the coding tasks, we enforced the homogeneity of the groups by ensuring
that: 1) no group entirely contained participants that were only professional developers or only students, 2) no group entirely contained
participants from a specific geographic location and–or academic institution, 3) each participant completed the tasks assigned to him
independently and without consulting with others 4) each group had same number of four coding tasks 5) each group had exposure to all four development settings as part of the four development tasks. The use of balanced groups simplified and enhanced the statistical
analysis of the collected data.

Four Coding Tasks. Each task was required to be completed using a pre-selected API. Thus for
the four tasks, each participant needed to use four different APIs: Jackson, Gson, Xstream, and Spring framework.
Jackson and Gson are two of the most popular Java APIs for JSON parsing [21]. Spring is one of the most popular web framework in
Java and XStream is well-regarded for its efficient adherence to the JAXB principles, i.e., XML to JSON conversion and vice
versa.

All of the four APIs can be found in the list of top 10 most discussed APIs in our evaluation corpus. The APIs are mature and are
fairly large and thus can be hard to learn. The largest API is the Spring framework 5.0.5 with a total of 3687 types (Class, Annotation,
Exception, and Annotation), followed by Jackson 2.2 (467 types), XStream 1.4.10 (340 types), and Gson 2.8.4 (34 types). For Jackson
API, we counted the code types that are shipped with the core modules (jackson-core, databind, and annotations). The Jackson API has
been growing with the addition of more modules (e.g., jackson-datatype). The four APIs have a total of 4528 types. In comparison, the
entire Java SE 7 SDK has a total of 4024 code types, and the entire Java SE 8 SDK has a total of 4240 code types

### Task Settings. 
For each coding task, we prepared four settings:
SO complete the task only with the help of Stack Overflow;
DO complete the task only with the help of API official documentation
OP complete the task only with the help of [TOOL]
EV complete the task with any resources available (i.e., SO, DO, [TOOL], and Search engines).

The participants were divided into four groups (G1, G2, G3, G4). Each participant in a group was asked to complete the four tasks. 

Task Selection Rationale. The four tasks were picked randomly from our evaluation corpus of 22.7K Stack Overflow posts. Each
task was observed in Stack Overflow posts more than once and was asked by more than one developer. Each task was related to the
manipulation of JSON inputs using Java APIs for JSON parsing. The manipulation of JSON-based inputs is prevalent in disk-based,
networked as well as HTTP-based message, file, and object processing. Therefore, the Java APIs for JSON parsing offer many complex
features to support the diverse development needs. The solution to each task spanned over two posts. The two posts are from two
different threads in Stack Overflow. Thus the developers could search in Stack Overflow to find the solutions. However, that would
require those searching posts from multiple threads in Stack Overflow. All of those tasks are common using the four APIs. Each post
related to the tasks was viewed and upvoted more than hundred times in Stack Overflow. To ensure that each development resource
was treated with equal fairness during the completion of the development tasks, we also made sure that each task could be completed
using any of the development resources, i.e., the solution to each task could be found in any of the resources at a given time, without
the need to rely on the other resources.

• Coding Guide. A seven-page coding guide was produced to explain the study requirements. Before each participant was invited to
complete the study, he had to read the entire coding guide. Each participant was encouraged to ask questions to clarify the study details
before and during the study. To respond to the questions the participants communicated with the first author over Skype. Each participant
was already familiar with formal and informal documentation resources. To ensure a fair comparison of the different resources used
to complete the tasks, each participant was given a brief demo of [TOOL] before the beginning of the study. This was done by giving
them an access to the [TOOL] web site.
• Data Collection Process. The study was performed in a Google Form, where participation was by invitation only. Four versions of
the form were generated, each corresponding to one group. Each group was given access to one version of the form representing the
group. The developers were asked to write the solution to each coding task in a text box reserved for the task. The developers were
encouraged to use any IDE that they are familiar with, to code the solution to the tasks. 

Before starting each task, a participant was asked to mark down the beginning time. After completing a solution the participant was
again asked to mark the time of completion of the task. The participant was encouraged to not take any break during the completion of
the task (after he marked the starting time of the task). To avoid fatigue, each participant was encouraged to take a short break between
two tasks. Besides completing each coding task, each participant was also asked to assess the complexity and effort required for each
task, using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX)

### Participants
Each of the studies was conducted separately. The survey was conducted after the participants completed their coding tasks. The 31
participants in the coding tasks are divided into four groups (G1-G4). Each of three groups (G1, G3, G4) had eight participants. Among
the 31 participants, 18 were recruited through the online professional social network site, Freelancer.com. The rest of the participants
were recruited from four universities. Among the participants recruited from the universities, eight reported their profession as students,
two as graduate researchers, and rest as software engineers and student. Among the 31 participants 88.2% were actively involved in
software development (94.4% among the freelancers and 81.3% among the university participants). Each participant had a background
in computer science and software engineering.
The number of years of experience of the participants in software development ranged between less than one year to more than 10
years: three (all of them being students) with less than one year of experience, nine between one and two, 12 between three and six,
four between seven and 10 and the rest (nine) had more than 10 years of experience. Among the four participants that were not actively
involved in daily development activities, one was a business analyst (a freelancer) and three were students (university participants). The
business data analyst had between three and six years of development experience in Java. The diversity in the participant occupation
offered us insights into whether and how [TOOL] was useful to all participants in general.

### Study Data Analysis

We analyzed each solution to a coding task using three metrics:
1) Correctness. How accurate is the provided solution to support the coding task?
2) Time. How much time was spent to code the solution?
3) Effort. How much effort was required to code the solution?

## Results

Participants showed better performance when using [TOOL] only, than when using every available resources
(which included [TOOL], formal documentation, Stack Overflow, and Search Engines) during the coding tasks. The participants
reported that they were familiar with Stack Overflow and the official documentations, but that they needed time to learn [TOOL]. Thus,
they may have started exploring those resources before resorting to [TOOL] for their coding solution when they were allowed to use
all the resources. Several participants mentioned that they found the coding tasks to be difficult. This difficulty contributed to the lower number of participants providing completely accurate solution.

The correctness of the provided solutions were the lowest when participants used only Stack Overflow.
Participants on average spent the highest amount of time and effort per coding solution when using only the formal
documentation. The lowest correctness while using Stack Overflow shows the difficulties that the participants faced to piece together
a solution from multiple forum threads that may not be discoverable (e.g., they are not connected together). Since the formal
documentation did have all the solutions, it was a matter of finding and piecing those solutions together.

The participants spent less time while using [TOOL], than the other resources for the two tasks (TG, TS). For
the task TX, participants spent on average 19.4 minutes using [TOOL] was the second best behind (17.3 minuties) only Stack
Overflow (the lowest completion time). 

The participants mostly (more than 90%) agreed that the [TOOL] usage summaries did indeed offer improve-
ments over formal documentation. The participants appreciated the following improvements in [TOOL] over API official
documentation: 1) Uptodateness of the scenarios, and 2) Presence of sentiments to validate the effectiveness of usage scenarios.
The participants suggest to combine the strengths of each summary into their decision making process, “Statistical summary would
help me to find the users decisions about the API. I would chose conceptual summary and over other summaries rather than formal
documentation because these provides the usage example with positive and negative reaction.”

 One particular reason of moving to [TOOL] from official documentation is that [TOOL] can stay up to date,
while API official documentation can be often obsolete. For example, one participant still considers API official documentation
as the starting point to learn an API, but wants to leverage [TOOL] more over time as they want to learn more about the API: “Formal
documentation will almost always be the starting point for new APIs. But as the APIs start to grow, [TOOL] will serve as the most
useful tool to find correct solutions to the problems in less time, become familiar with the trends and compare different alternatives.”


More than 80% of the participants agreed that [TOOL] summaries offered increases in productivity, confidence,
and saved time over the informal documentation. According to one developer “there are some sections like conceptual summary
and code example would be useful for developer on daily basis”.

The participants considered learning an API using [TOOL] could be quicker than while using Stack Overflow,
because [TOOL] synthesizes the information from Stack Overflow by APIs using both sentiment and source code analyses.
According to one participant “It is quicker to find solution in [TOOL] since the subject is well covered and useful information is
collected.” The participants mentioned that [TOOL] offers more features than Stack Overflow to learn an API: “[TOOL] has
more feature set to help the developers find out the better API for a task. The evaluation and nice presentation of positive and negative sentiments help them decide an API.”
